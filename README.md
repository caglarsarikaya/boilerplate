# boilerplate

I'm building this to help you get started quickly. 

-in data layer there is fluent api for entity settings and seed for throw in sample data.
-in core layer there is repository and also each class extends the repo if you want to add some new features to class except standart repo features
-in business layer there is middleware for password process with sha256
-in presentation layer there is dto class which I used for show only selected data alias to user from the response of databases

I had help from one of my favorite coders, Jason.
